## Team communication

The team's communication tool is discord, It used to be a French server, but we now have dedicated English channel. 
The Github wiki contains most of the important informations, and we use Github issues to keep track of the current tasks.

## Third party tools

We use Sonar and Sonarcloud to keep the code quality in check. You can see some badge on most plugins Readme showing if we passed the quality gate. 
We also use Travis as a CI system, building the application each time we push a commit - the failing builds being marked as so within Readme badges.

## Onaple repositories

The Onaple project revolves around a few repositories dedicated to some theme. 
We try to keep those separated to avoid generating one big messy plug-in that would only suit our own needs. 
You can see the features available and being developed into the features page of the wiki.
